# Monitoring and Analyzing a News site

## What I've done
I've gathered information from a site using the modules ***BeautifulSoup*** and ***requests***. Then I've saved that data into a ***.cvs*** file. 
Using that data and ***MatPlotLib*** I've represented the data in a easily recognizable way.

## What I hope to implement
Maybe someday try gathering the data into a database just to widen the scope of the project.
